    <h1>Quick Bibimbap Recipe</h1>

    <p>Hey, what's up? In my house, bibimbap—or some version of kimchi and eggs on rice—is on the menu every week. Today, I'm going to show you how to make my not very authentic but very delicious version that only takes about 25 minutes. This is a weeknight lifesaver.</p>

    <h2>Pickled Veg</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>To get started, I'll need to make some pickles. First up, cucumber. I usually have a pack of these baby cukes in the fridge. They’re great for quick pickling and don’t need seeding or peeling.</p>
        
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>4 baby cucumbers</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cups bean sprouts</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded carrots</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>1. Slice the Cucumbers:</strong> Cut the ends off and slice them into semi-thin coins. For a weeknight supper and some leftovers, I’ll use about four of these baby cucumbers, which should yield about two cups.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Marinate the Cucumbers:</strong> In a bowl, add a heaping tablespoon of salt, the same amount of sugar, and about two tablespoons of rice vinegar. Toss everything together to release some liquid from the cucumbers. The result should be a bright, sweet, and tangy flavor that makes your mouth buzz. Set them aside.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Bean Sprouts:</strong> In the same bowl, add two cups of bean sprouts. Add a heavy tablespoon of salt, the same amount of sugar, and two tablespoons of rice vinegar. Add some sesame seeds and toss everything to combine. Set aside.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Carrots:</strong> Use a julienne peeler to shred two cups of carrots. If you don’t have a julienne peeler, just slice them thinly. In the same bowl, add one heaping tablespoon of salt, the same amount of sugar, and two tablespoons of rice vinegar. Toss to combine and let everything marinate for 20 minutes while you prep the rest.</p>

    <h2>Ground Beef Bulgogi</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>Next, we’ll make something that resembles Korean bulgogi, but with ground beef for simplicity.</p>
        
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>1 pound 80/20 ground beef</li>
            <li>100 grams soy sauce</li>
            <li>15 grams sesame oil</li>
            <li>25 grams rice vinegar</li>
            <li>25 grams brown sugar</li>
            <li>20 grams grated ginger</li>
            <li>10 grams grated garlic</li>
            <li>15 grams gochujang sauce (or sriracha/sambal paste)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>1. Cook the Beef:</strong> Heat a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and break it down into small chunks. Cook for 4-5 minutes until browned and crumbled. This will give it a nice crusty sear.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a container, mix together 100 grams soy sauce, 15 grams sesame oil, 25 grams rice vinegar, 25 grams brown sugar, 20 grams grated ginger, 10 grams grated garlic, and 15 grams gochujang. Stir until well combined.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Glaze the Beef:</strong> Add the marinade to the beef and cook it down until it becomes a sticky glaze, about 60 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl to cool.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Sauteed Sesame Spinach</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>Next, we’ll sauté some spinach to add a green element to our bibimbap.</p>
        
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>1 pound large leaf spinach</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>1. Cook the Spinach:</strong> Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the spinach, a pinch of salt, and sesame seeds. Cook for about 90 seconds until the spinach is wilted but not mushy. Transfer to a bowl to cool or place directly on top of the beef if you want to save on dishes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Bibimbap Sauce</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>For the sauce, which adds a tangy, spicy kick, mix the following ingredients.</p>
        
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>200 grams gochujang sauce</li>
            <li>50 grams water</li>
            <li>15 grams sugar</li>
            <li>3 grams salt</li>
            <li>30 grams sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>10-15 grams ginger, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>1. Make the Sauce:</strong> In a high-sided container, combine 200 grams gochujang sauce, 50 grams water, 15 grams sugar, 3 grams salt, 30 grams sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Use an immersion blender to mix until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, grate the ginger and garlic and stir everything together.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Cook the Eggs</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>Finally, fry the eggs which are essential for a classic bibimbap.</p>
        
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>1. Fry the Eggs:</strong> Heat a low pan over medium heat and add a few drops of oil. Crack in the eggs and season with salt. Cover with a lid and cook for 2-2.5 minutes. The runny yolk is essential for mixing into the rice.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>Now it’s time to assemble your bibimbap.</p>
        
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>1.5 cups hot cooked rice (or high-quality frozen rice)</li>
            <li>4 ounces glazed bulgogi ground beef</li>
            <li>Sauteed sesame spinach</li>
            <li>Marinated carrots</li>
            <li>Marinated cucumbers</li>
            <li>Marinated bean sprouts</li>
            <li>Kimchi (chopped)</li>
            <li>2 sunny-side up eggs</li>
            <li>Scallions and sesame seeds for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>1. Assemble the Bibimbap:</strong> In a bowl, place 1.5 cups of hot rice. Top with 4 ounces of the glazed beef, sautéed spinach, marinated carrots, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and chopped kimchi. Add the sunny-side up eggs on top. Garnish with scallions, sesame seeds, and drizzle with bibimbap sauce.</p>
        <p>Enjoy your vibrant, crunchy, salty, sweet, sour, funky, spicy, starchy, and eggy bibimbap!</p>
