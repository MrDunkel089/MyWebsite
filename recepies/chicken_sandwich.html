    <h1>Buffalo Chicken Sandwich Recipe</h1>

    <p>Hey, what's up? One day somebody actually said to themselves, "Hey man, let's take fried chicken— you know, that food that's nearly perfect on its own—yeah, let's take that and put buttery hot sauce all over it and just see what happens." Today, I'm gonna show you what happens, and spoiler alert: it's dope and it only takes like 25 minutes to make. To get started, I'm gonna need some chicken.</p>

    <h2>Prepping the Chicken</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>Specifically, I've got six 3-4 ounce pieces of boneless, skinless chicken thighs here. I think thighs are the right move for a quick fried chicken sandwich because they require no marination or brining to be delicious and they come in these perfectly sandwich-sized portions right out of the package.</p>
        <p>Quickly, I'm gonna hit these thighs liberally with salt on both sides. The breading that I'm gonna coat them in will be seasoned itself as well, but getting some additional salt right on the meat really helps with their overall flavor. Once these are all salted up, I'll set them aside for just a second while I make the breading.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Dredging and Breading</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>For the breading, I'll grab a medium bowl and intuit measure:</p>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>300 grams of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>5 grams of salt</li>
            <li>2-3 grams of black pepper</li>
            <li>3 grams of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>3 grams of paprika</li>
            <li>5 grams of garlic powder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'll grab a whisk and jump into the bowl to get everything combined. Once it is combined, I'll grab two bowls. Into one of them, I'll add 300 grams of buttermilk, and into the other, I'll add about 200 grams of all-purpose flour. To finish the breading, I'll grab the buttermilk and drizzle about a quarter cup right into the seasoned flour. Then, using a whisk, I'll stir to get that hydrated with the flour. The key here is to create some extra clumpy bits of hydrated flour that will turn into super crispy cragginess once fried on the outside. The final texture of the breading should still be kind of dry and slightly powdery but clumpy.</p>
        <p>Next, I'll grab my salted meat and drop the first piece into the unseasoned all-purpose flour. This base layer of flour is going to absorb any of the moisture that came out of the chicken from salting and it will also help grab the buttermilk that we dunk it in. Speaking of buttermilk, once this thigh is very well dusted with flour, I'll shake it off to remove any excessive flour and then lay it into the buttermilk using tongs. Now I'm gonna flip the thigh to make sure that I'm getting good even coverage here. Once this thigh is all milked up like this, I'll move it over to the crumbly breading mixture that we just made. From there, I'll give it a shake to get it covered with the breading. Once it's buried in there, I'll come back with my hands to flip it around and make sure that it's evenly coated. I'll give it some light pressing to make sure that it's fully covered and to make sure that the breading is really stuck on there. There we go. Now I'll move it over to a little baby sheet tray to rest for about five to ten minutes so that the flour on the outside can hydrate a little bit more. I'll bread the rest of these thighs now and once they're all covered, I'll get my fryer ready for the fried chicken.</p>

    <h2>Preparing the Fryer</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>To do that, I'll grab a heavy-bottomed pot like this 6.5-quart Dutch oven and drop it on the stove over medium heat. Into that, I'll glug 2 quarts of neutral oil. I'm using vegetable oil here, but canola, peanut, or corn oil would also work. Two quarts will give me about three inches of oil depth in this pot, which is perfect to submerge these thighs. While this oil slowly gets hot, I'm gonna make my favorite condiment for this style of sandwich—creamy chunky blue cheese dressing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Making the Blue Cheese Dressing</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>For that, I'll grab a high-sided container and into it measure:</p>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>75 grams of buttermilk</li>
            <li>60 grams of sour cream</li>
            <li>15 grams of lemon juice</li>
            <li>A half of a clove of garlic</li>
            <li>10 grams of rinsed shallot or red onion</li>
            <li>5 grams of salt</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk (or most of one yolk)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Get it all in there, dude, and oh, that's good enough. Then I'll grab 300 grams of neutral oil (in this case, light olive oil) and then I'll grab an immersion blender and start to spin this up. Once that's all pureed, I'll drizzle in the oil slowly to get it properly emulsified. This tall container is great for making emulsified dressings, but as you can see, when the dressing starts to get thick, the oil just kind of sits there on top. That could lead to a broken sauce eventually, so I'll stop the blender, spin up the top to get any loose oil incorporated, and then I'll add the last little bit of oil and spin that in, making sure to get it moved around from the top to the bottom too much oil in one place could break this dressing. There we go. Now we have what is essentially a very good-tasting ranch dressing. To make it into blue cheese dressing, I'll add in 50 grams of very well crumbled blue cheese. Using the immersion blender again, I'll spin that in for 10 to 15 seconds or until it's relatively creamy and mixed in with the base ranch dressing. I prefer to buy a little piece of nice-tasting blue cheese and then chop it up myself. It makes it much easier to blend in. Once that first 50 grams of blue cheese is spun into the base, I'll add the other half (or most of it) depending on how much you like blue cheese and then I'll stir that in to combine. Now we've got a nice creamy, subtly funky dressing with small chunks of delicious blue cheese floating throughout. If you guys don't like blue cheese, I get it, but I still think you might like this dressing because in the end it's basically ranch and the blue cheese flavor is not that in-your-face.</p>

    <h2>Buffalo Sauce (It's Basically Hot Sauce and Butter)</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>For the buffalo part of this sandwich, I'll set aside my dressing and then grab a small saucepan. Into it, I'll intuitively measure:</p>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>300 grams of Frank's hot sauce (in my opinion, Frank's is the best option for buffalo sauce, but if you've got another brand, go for it)</li>
            <li>15 grams of well minced garlic</li>
            <li>20 grams of Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>15 grams of white distilled vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'll move this pot over to the stove and heat it over medium-high heat. From there, I'll whisk in the garlic and bring the whole thing up to a simmer. I'll cook this until the hot sauce has reduced a little bit and the garlic has lost its raw edge—about 4 to 5 minutes. When the garlic is nice and tender and the sauce has slightly thickened like this, I'll add in 150 grams of cubed butter and whisk that in. And that's buffalo sauce. If you didn't know, it's essentially just Frank's hot sauce with a load of butter in it. How can something so simple and dumb be so delicious? It’s an amazing question. Now, the trouble with buffalo sauce is that it breaks. There's melted butter in there, and when it gets hot, it will break. To help keep this emulsified, I'm going to add in an optional small pinch of xanthan gum. If you don't have
